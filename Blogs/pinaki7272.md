# 15 Free Coding Games To Improve And Level Up Your Coding Skills

-Practice and improve your coding skills the fun way with these 15 free online games.


-When I started learning to code, my options for practicing coding skills were limited â€” lots of books, some very basic online tutorials, some coding challenges, and a whole lot of experimentation. These days, in addition to interactive courses and tutorials, there are lots of free coding games you can check out to improve your coding skills and take your programming skills to the next level.

-Are there any games that teach coding?

-The answer is: Yes! And no computer science degree is required. You can play coding games to learn coding skills â€“ including all sorts of different programming languages. With coding games, youâ€™ll hone your problem-solving skills, improve your knowledge of programming concepts, and enjoy the learning process too.

-While a coding game alone probably isnâ€™t going to teach you everything you need to know about coding, these free fun games can be a really incredible way to practice the skills youâ€™re learning. If youâ€™re anything like me, youâ€™ll suddenly realize youâ€™ve spent the last four hours reinforcing your JavaScript, Python, and other coding skills without even realizing it.
